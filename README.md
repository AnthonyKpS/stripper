# Stripper

Stripper is a small shell script that stripps shell script comments out of, you guessed it: shell scripts. For now, it serves as a task completed for the the Lab of DIT136 at [dit.hua](https://www.dit.hua.gr/index.php/en/)


## Installation

Clone the repo.


## Usage
Execute it in the root directory...

```bash
./stripper shell_script.sh
```
Or add stripper to your environment and do

```bash
stripper shell_script.sh
```
wherever you want.

## Results
Stripper will NOT make any deletions to the file that you provided. Instead, a file named stripped.sh will be made in the root directory.

## Future
It is possible I may upgrade this to be able to strip comments from other languages aswell.
